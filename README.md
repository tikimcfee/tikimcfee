### Greetings, fellow entity 👋

Technology has a special place in my mind and heart. Always has, always will. I love hearing about the incredibly technically elaborate (even if I don't understand it) and the awe inspiringly simple and useful. Everything in between is also fair game. Just share whatever you think is cool - I'll likely think the same.

I appreciate your taking the time to read this, and welcome you to my corporately-allocated corner of the dev world - here, you are welcome!

### My current focus: Code Visualiation in AR

My one current major project in flight is [LookAtThat](https://github.com/tikimcfee/LookAtThat), a terrible name for an exciting project that reads, analyzes, renders, and makes three-dimensionally-interactable your code. It currently support Swift. Unless I've gone mad and become explosively productive, support for other language-level AST analysis is still in the works (looking at you, [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)). However, rendering arbitrary blocks of text is easy peasy.

I love collaborating, mentoring, teaching, and being a generally open and transparent developer advocate. If something interests you, or you have a fun idea, **LET ME KNOW!** There are few things in life as equally important as validation of one's thoughts and ideas, so here ya go, I offer some!
